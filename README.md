ImageJ Legacy Bridge
--------------------

The legacy component enables backward compatibility between
[ImageJ2](https://github.com/imagej/imagej) and
[ImageJ 1.x](https://github.com/imagej/ImageJA).

It contains the code necessary to translate ImageJ images into ImageJ1 format
and back, so that legacy plugins can be executed faithfully.
